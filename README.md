# Data Compressor Using Huffman Encoding

For my final project in COSC 320, I had to use the Huffman encoding algorithm to create a data compressor/decompressor. This program will first ask the user whether they would like to compress their file, or decompress it. Once the user has made their choice, they will be asked to input a valid file name to be subjected to their selected process. After the compression or decompression has finished, a new file will be created.
After compression, there will be two output files: the compressed initial file and the statistics file for the Huffman tree. To decompress a file, both of these files must be presented. The result of the decompression will be the original input file.
